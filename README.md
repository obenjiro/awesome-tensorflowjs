# Awesome TensorFlowJS

A curated list of awesome TensorFlow JavaScript experiments, libraries, and projects. Inspired by awesome-tensorflow.

## What is TensorFlowJS?

TensorFlowJS is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. In other words, the best way to build deep learning models in browser and Node.js
